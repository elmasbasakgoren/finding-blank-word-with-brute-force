# finding-blank-word-with-brute-force

Analysis of Algorithms Term Project

This algorithms is a brute force algorithms which try to fill in the blank from statement file in order to the_truman_show_script.
We use python for our project because of ease of code. We use only numpy library for our project. 
Program will execute the codes that are written and fill in the blank of sentences and then show the whole sentence.
 Output will be like:
looks up into the sky but there is no plane in sight
truman regards his companion in a new light he comes
god truman almost hit marilyn he s on the move again passing the burger king
truman notices that the traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of pedestrians
truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer
you know what was really strange about today



We tried to find a correct function to reach the correct answer, this functions were:

def _find_path()
def_find()
start()

and besides that, some of the python functions are used in the code for purposes of easy usage:

range()
length()
map()
enumarate()
list()
and also lambda has been used for easy usage of the functions. 



The program will evaluate the running time in the end of the running, our running times might be changed accordingly, but it can be said that the estimated running time is very close to 0.03.
